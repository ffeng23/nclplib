This is a project to do alignment dll for running cloanalyst linux version.

In here, we define the code and make a dll (CLPLib.so) being referenced by
cloanalyst.dll for doing alignment, etc.

code belongs to Axin (or Tom). The project was created by Feng.

To install/deploy the library, libCLPLib.so.1.0, we need to link this one to the /usr/lib/libCLPLib.so or link to the cloanalyst.dll folder libCLPLib.so. (NOTE: it is better to link to the libCLPLib.so in the same fold as the cloanalyst.dll. that one is more like a stable library and the one this current fold is sort of developing version.)

no major addition. adding code to get familimar with how the alignment works

In PairwiseAligner, FillMatrix is to do the alignment (two rounds, first round to get the score and longest part and then second round
based on the aligned part and fill the matrix).
One thing to note is that the alignment score is different from the score matrix based on the probility. 
the alignment score takes into consideration of the score and the sequence length. It is normalized by the prior score (purely random
between 4nts) and the cumulative prior score contains the length information. the final score is normalize and scaled to the total length
of the sequence (Not just the part of the alignment)

also fix the code to get rid of the warning of compiling
1) int to unsigned
2) the order the variables in the initialization list.
