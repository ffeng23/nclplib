This is a project to do alignment dll for running cloanalyst linux version.

In here, we define the code and make a dll (CLPLib.so) being referenced by
cloanalyst.dll for doing alignment, etc.

code belongs to Axin (or Tom). The project was created by Feng.

To install/deploy the library, libCLPLib.so.1.0, we need to link this one to the /usr/lib/libCLPLib.so or link to the cloanalyst.dll folder libCLPLib.so.
